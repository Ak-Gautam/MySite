			<p>Hi,<br> I am a sophmore undergraduate pursuing bachelor's degree in IT.
				Robotics is my hobby and machine learning is my passion, I know a bit of IoT as well.
				I learned coding with C++ and later picked up the C language basics as well as 
				Python3 and because I'm more into Machine Learning, Python3 became my strong suite.
				I love creating robots which can solve real world problems, I mostly use simple
				electonics like Arduino and Raspberry pi for prototyping. I have good communication
				skills and can lead a team successfully.
